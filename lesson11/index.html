            <h3>Developing Town: Traversing the 'Riverbottoms'</h3>
            <p>As the population of the community of Bridgeport moved away that area, part of the Mendenhall and Frew family ranches, become referred to as “The Riverbottoms.” The Bridgeport Branch of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints faded away and those homes north of the state road (HWY 36) were included in the Dayton Ward, while those south of the road joined the Weston Ward. “The Frew family gave the ground for the present Highway 36 to the State of Idaho.”</p>
            <p>Around 1890 the bridge crossing Bear River on the highway was constructed. A road wound its way back and forth up the eastern hillside to Preston. The old bridge failed about 1952 when there was a Greyhound Bus accident. Due to this a new bridge was installed about 400 yards to the left, and a much straighter road was engineered to climb the hill.</p>
            <p>In the meantime two more bridges crossed the Bear. One was known as the Deep Creek Bridge, the other, to the south was the Weston Bridge. There were also regularly used fording places, available when the water was low in the river. Drivers had to be careful using the fords due to the possibilities of quicksand and also of dropping off into a deeper hole on either side of the traveled crossings.</p>
            <p>The Riverbottoms stretched on both sides of the Bear River as it wound its way through the county. At the southern end it was five or six miles west of the bustling town of Franklin, then reached to the north to Battle Creek and the lower end of the Riverdale community. There was another bridge across the Bear River constructed during the hey days of Battle Creek when it was the terminus for the Utah Northern Railroad as it was extending its way to the northwest. The locals simply called it the Railroad Bridge but when the boomtown dwindled it was used as one more way to cross the river barrier across the wide valley of the county.</p>
